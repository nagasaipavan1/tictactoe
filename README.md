- Players take turns selecting squares on the 3x3 grid.
- The current player's symbol (X or O) will be displayed on the selected square.
- Clicking a square that's already filled will have no effect.
- The game automatically checks for a winner after each turn.
- If a player fills three squares in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.

**Game Over:**

- When a winner is declared, a congratulatory message is displayed.
- The game board is disabled to prevent further moves.
- A "Rematch!" button allows you to start a new game with the same players.

- Customization options for player names and symbols
